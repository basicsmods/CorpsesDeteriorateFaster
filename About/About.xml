	<description>One part of late game slowdown is all the extra items and corpses on your map. This mod makes it so corpses deteriorate faster so they get off your map faster and get your performance back. I would also like to make a bunch of other items deteriorate faster (specifically items that are commonly dropped by raiders when they get downed and that I don't usually care about retrieving with any haste).</description>
